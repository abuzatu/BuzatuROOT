The Course folder contains lectures. Each has a .pdf lecture, examples in Task, a homework in Task, then the solution shown in Solution. Please try on your own the solution before you check it. 

The Package folder contains examples that just compile and work. It has a README.txt file that should be your starting point. Basically you need to cd there, type make, and it all compiles. You can run from the bin folder.
